<h1>Helix-Ready Deployment</h1>
<h4>The objective of this process is to redeploy the configurations of our Frappe project instance to a newly designated server.</h4>

<p>
Our primary aim is to export the backup files of our current Frappe project to facilitate their import onto the new server. This process is effective because configurations performed on the client side are stored within the existing database.
</p>

<p>
  Consequently, all data entries, tables, columns, rows, and any customized data are processed and recorded as database entries, ensuring that the entire configuration can be transferred seamlessly.
</p>
